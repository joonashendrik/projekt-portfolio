                <h1>HISTORY</h1>
                <a>Mickey was first seen in a test screening of the cartoon short Plane Crazy, on May 15, 1928
                    In Mickey's early films he was often characterized not as a hero, but as an ineffective young suitor to Minnie Mouse.
                    The Barn Dance (March 14, 1929) is the first time in which Mickey is turned down by Minnie in favor of Pete.
                    In the 1950s, Mickey became more known for his appearances on television, particularly with The Mickey Mouse Club.
                    Many of his theatrical cartoon shorts were rereleased on television series,
                    various forms of the Walt Disney anthology television series, and on home video.</a>
